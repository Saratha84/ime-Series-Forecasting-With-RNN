# ime-Series-Forecasting-With-RNN
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future values in a time series dataset. It involves preprocessing data, training an LSTM model, and making predictions on test data. The example code is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.


In this project, I explored the power of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast future values in time series data. Leveraging Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, I built an LSTM model capable of making accurate predictions based on historical data.

üîç Key Highlights:

    Data Preprocessing: Normalized the dataset using MinMaxScaler and split it into training and testing sets.
    Model Training: Defined an LSTM architecture and trained the model using the training data.
    Prediction: Utilized the trained model to forecast future values on unseen test data.
    Visualization: Plotted actual vs. predicted values to evaluate model performance.

üí° Skills Utilized:

    Python
    TensorFlow
    Keras
    NumPy
    pandas
    scikit-learn

üìä Outcome:
The LSTM model demonstrated promising results in predicting future values, showcasing its potential applications in various domains such as finance, weather forecasting, and more.
