# ime-Series-Forecasting-With-RNN
This project demonstrates the use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict future values in a time series dataset. It involves preprocessing data, training an LSTM model, and making predictions on test data. The example code is built using Python and popular libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and NumPy.
